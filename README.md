# ImageClassifierDeepLearning

First big problem:
TensorFlow Requires Python version 64bit. Installed a parallel version of 3.6.5_64bit

Changed executable name to python64
Added Path to Environment Variable

This is a Tutorial to Learn about Object Detection using Tensor Flow

The idea would be to leverage the new TensorFlow.Hub tool to load already pretty well trained models, and then do a Transfer Learning to work with s desired specific subset of objects to be detected.
